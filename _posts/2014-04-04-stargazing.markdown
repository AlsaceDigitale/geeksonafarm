When was the last time you looked up at the stars while walking in Paris or Berlin? We know it's difficult. Because of the light pollution or because of the lack of time. Or because you're taken by your daily actions. Join us at Geeks On A Farm and you will find this time while learning new things and meet new people. Stargazing is the perfect moment to think about yourself and what you will accomplish next!
